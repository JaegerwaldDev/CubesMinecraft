## Building Block code from game assets (resourcepack)
Written by Jae, hi :>

The blocks in this game are modular, so you can build from any version (maybe even mods) and add those to the game.

To start, here is what you need to do:
1. Go to `gen`
2. Start `build_setup.py` and follow as instructed. (Manual adjusting of some blocks (eg. grass block) is sometimes needed.)
3. Start `build.py`, and copy the files in the `generated` folder into the root folder. Then copy the textures folder into the root folder.
